## Questions

In the Jupyter Notebook we are answering the following questions:

 1) What are the variables that are highly correlated with the Diabetes Mellitus (target one)?
 2) What are the ones that have a low correlation with it?
 3) Considering our dataset, which disease is causing more number of days in hospital admission before icu (pre_icu_los_days)?
 4) Considering the correlation between weight and Diabetes Mellitus, is there a significant difference in weights among people with different ethnical backgrounds?
 5) Sometimes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) there are patients that don't have a complete clinical history immediately available.  In ICU time is very important to save lives and the question many doctors want to know is the following: can we derive if a patient has the Diabetes Mellitus (chronic disease) from the tests that we are doing when we admit him in the unit?
 
To answer them we are using the typical steps of a data science process: gather, assess, clean, analyze, model and visualize. The visualisation of the data is a continous point that is happening during all the steps of the process.
